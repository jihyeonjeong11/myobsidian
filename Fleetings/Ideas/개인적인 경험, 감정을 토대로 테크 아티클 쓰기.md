// 이거 다음 글 쓸때 이렇게 밝히고 하자

_Let’s talk Personal Knowledge Management Systems, Arachne’s curse, broken brains, and how tech is good **sometimes.**_

// 무엇에 대해 말할것인지? 에 대해 먼저 밝히기 PKM - Zettelkasten

Everything you learn - from 3 year old you eagerly learning to count to 10 to 35 year old you reluctantly learning how NFTs work - is a thread of personal knowledge.

The time it takes to get to your office on a rainy day is a thread. The way your mother smelled is a thread. The sound of the door shutting one last time behind your ex is a thread. Everything you’ve read here? Threads! (I hope that’s okay!)

// 개인적인 지식이란 뭘까? 모든 경험이다.

The thing with personal knowledge is…there’s a lot of it. And threads slip out of our minds every single day. That’s good a lot of the time. We don’t need to hold onto every thread. But sometimes, we lose threads we wanted to keep. Many people use Personal Knowledge Systems to help them hold onto those threads. PKMS are just systems used to catalogue notes, ideas, research and memories. Lots of people call their PKMS their second brain. 

// 하지만 사람은 우리가 잊고 싶지않았던 기억도 잊는 경향이 있다. 이것을 도와주는것이 PKM이다.

PKMS vary! Some people keep detailed journals, some have computers full of files. Some people write on napkins or moleskins. Believe it or not, if you have ever used Facebook, you’ve been using a kind of PKMS - it’s a place reminds you of your friends’ birthdays through alerts, or keeps track of memories with a feed that lets you scroll backward. Or at least it _did_ both those things when you still used it. 

And, of course, historically, lots of men treat their wives like secretaries and their secretaries like a PKMS, they don’t care how the system works as long as the women in their lives can always fetch information from it. 



Do you know any husbands and fathers who don’t make any of their kids doctor’s appointments, remember their birthdays, make grocery shopping lists, or book summer camps because their wives will tell them what they need to know? Well, you know a man using his wife as his second brain!

Anyways. 

// 사족

One particularly effective PKMS is called _Zettelkasten_. Zettelkasten means “box of slips.” This kind of knowledge management involves keeping very small bits of information on index cards filed through subject headings or numeric systems. Like,

// 제텔카스텐 소개 시작.

>_The German philosopher Walter Benjamin used notecards filed with a number system to keep track of the notes for his monumental Arcades Project._ [_1_](https://homeculture.substack.com/p/software-helps-my-adhd-brain-think#footnote-1-129548667)

// 일화의 경우 >를 붙여가지고 적기

could go on a single notecard. Perhaps filed under the subject heading, “Note-taking.” 

Then, when you wanted to know about note-taking, you’d take out all the notecards under that subject heading, and many of the notecards those notecards cross reference, maybe things like “History of writing instruments” or “Taxonomy” and lay them all out together, arranging and rearranging until you found new connections. 

// 제텔카스텐이 어떤 것인지 설명, 문서간의 연관성 설명

The first time I read about Zettelkasten, it reminded me of how my brain works. I store little bites of information under subject headings. I close my eyes to see all the connections and cross-references. Then I choose my frame threads, radial threads, and viscid threads and start weaving a web. Knowledge isn’t about memorizing, it’s about understanding. And understanding is a weaving work. 

// 해당 책을 처음 보았을 때, 어떤 느낌이엇는지 nd start weaving a web

Zettelkasten has been around since at least the 1500s. Carl Linnaeus used a version of this system while he became “the father of modern taxonomy.” _The German philosopher Walter Benjamin used notecards filed with a number system to keep track of the notes for his monumental Arcades Project._ And [**Anne Lamott is a fan too.**](https://bookshop.org/a/21587/9780385480017)

//사족? 저 위 일화와 같이 붙어있는 거인듯

I’ve tried to make a physical version of the inside of my head before. But the thing with a traditional Zettelkasten is…you have to keep track of slips of paper. And if you’ve been here long enough, you understand there is no smart storage solution that keep a slip of paper safe from my absent-mindedness.



I toyed with other systems, in the physical and digital realm. But none worked the way my brains works. I could never figure out how to use them in a way that helped me think.

// 나 자신의 경험.. 하지만 잘 되지 않았다

So I just decided that my brain and whatever I could cobble together on Google docs would have to be enough. But neither has been enough lately. And for the first time ever, my inability to organize my research and my thoughts has been severely impacting my ability to write.

I’m working with more threads these days. So I think that’s part of of it. But there’s something else going on. I don’t know if my memory is getting even worse because of long covid or something else. Or maybe I have just finally threaded too much into my already unsteady framework of a brain.

Whatever is going on, weaving the connections in my head into words that can connect has become a mythological feat - something for the gods, not mere mortal me. 

When Arachne claimed she could weave wonderful things, Athena cursed her and turned her into the very first spider. A small thing in a corner that weaves wonderful things no one ever looks up to see. I’ve always felt a bit like a house spider. 

> _Have you heard of the Barn Funnel Weaver Spider? If you haven’t heard of them, you’ve seen them. They’re some of the most common house spiders in the world. They go by other names, Common House Spider, Drain Spider, Lesser European House Spider. Their Latin name is Tegenaria Domestica. Tegenaria is their Genus and Domestica is their species. Domestica is from domesticus which means “belonging to the house.” This spider does belong to the house, to nearly all houses.  
>   
> According to the British Natural History Museum, the Barn Funnel Weaver is making its final worldwide migratory moves and “expanding their range in the north of England and Scotland. Before long, few locations where there are houses will remain free of them.” Common House Spider, indeed. I’m moved to ask on behalf of this eight-legged weaver what I’ve often asked on behalf of myself,  
>   
> I know this creature belongs to the house now, but what did it belong to before the house? And what did we call it then?_ - [A Defense of the Common House Spider](https://www.pocketobservatory.org/a-defense-of-the-common-house-spider/)

I don’t mind weaving in corners. But lately, I find myself in a corner with tangled thread. And it’s not just a pile of my work. It’s also so much of my _life_ - the memories and insights that make up my experience of mortality - are lost in that tangle. I can’t find the right threads. I’ve felt frantic and overwhelmed and very, very small. 

// adhd로 인생이 힘들었다.

And then last week, I found [**Capacities**](https://capacities.io/). And, I don’t know, I feel like everything is going to be okay. I mean, I’m no Arachne or even Barn Funnel Weaver. But I am going to be able to do my weaving work again. 

// 그렇게 시도를 해보았지만 잘 되지 않았다. 그런데 Capacities라는 걸 찾았다. 나는 옵시디언으로

This is how Capacities describes itself: 

> _Like an artist's studio, Capacities is a place for all your information. It stores your knowledge and can resurface it, right when you need it. It’s your own studio to collect, connect and reflect – a place to make sense of the world and to create amazing things._

![capacities](capacities.webp)

Me? I’d describe it as all of that _and_ an adaptive aid. It’s not a second brain for me, it’s helping me use my only brain. It works with my processing disorders, instead of trying to override them. 



Notes, thoughts, images, sounds, pdfs, zettelkasten cards and projects are all organized through tags, instead of files. Like here is my Capacities Zettel about Walter Benjamin,

// 그래서 이걸 통해서 어떻게 문제를 해결하려 하고 있다.

![usecase](capacity-usecase.jpg)

You can click on a tag and see the graph of related notes across all your categories - audio, cards, pdfs, longford, all of it. It looks a lot like a web, or a constellation. [**Or maybe a cosmic web?**](https://www.pocketobservatory.org/ive-slept-with-my-baby-blankie-for-36-years/)

I could be embarrassed about my baby blanket. Instead, I'll tell you everything it's taught me.

Here’s an example of connections made through the notes I took for an upcoming newsletter about butterflies. Well, _part_ of the newsletter is about butterflies. These are the notes for that _part._ Each point is longform writing, a note, a pdf, academic article or image. Watching it expand is just so damn satisfying. (The expansion happens like one second in.)

I guess Capacities is a little like a loom I can thread. A blessing for this spider-girl with too much thread and too little natural framing. 

This is not a paid endorsement, btw. I am just so relieved, I want any of you who need this kind of relief to get it. Bonus? Capacities is free. The paid level is a way to support the project. Being a supporter comes with cool upgrades. The minimum requested support is $12 a month. I’m giving a bit more. But free can easily get you started. 

My only grief with it so far? I wish there was a local-first option. Because Capacities is hosted on the cloud, it feels less in my control. And if it’s going to be my first and eventually second (???) brain, I want the option to do all my weaving off the cloud and on my computer. 

It’s important to remember, this is a very new product, created by a very small team. [**I think that local-first will get onto the Capacities roadmap someday**](https://capacities.io/roadmap). Until then? Capacities is based out of the EU, which means it’s got to answer to [**EU Privacy/Data Collection laws.**](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) It’s not nothing. 

Okay, back to our corners to weave wonderful things. I think people will look up to see. But a spider doesn’t weave to be witnessed, does she? She weaves to capture food, rest and, maybe, a little wonder for herself.
